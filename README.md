# Final Project Assignment 1: Exploration (FP1)
## My Library: html-writing and tzinfo
My name: Robert Cucchiara

I explored the html-writing library and tzinfo libraries.  I used the tzinfo mostly to see how functions and other libraries would play with html-writing. I ended up creating a small html page that prints out each time zone in an unpleasant format. I was unable to properly format the output which is something I will look into should I continue to pursue html-writing. I tried several different ways to format the large chunk of time zones but `(write-html-attribute-value-part)` and its counter parts were not very receptive to white space.  The code for this can be seen below along with another snippet of code which I used to explore other methods provided by this library.

```racket
#lang racket

(require html-writing)
(require tzinfo)

;;I wrote this to hopefully get the list of tzids to print as they do in drracket.
(define (output-list lst)
  (if (null? lst)
      "\n"
      (string-append (car lst) "\n" (output-list (cdr lst)))))

(define output (open-output-file "test.html"))
(write-html
 '((html (head (title "My Test of HTML Writing and Time Zone"))
         (body (@ (bgcolor "white"))
               (h1 "Introduction")
               (p "My name is Rob and I am turning in this assignment very late.")
               (p "Sad face.")
               (h2 "Fun with tzinfo")
               (p "list of time zones:")
               (p "I am not sure why all of the time zones print out like this. When running the car and cadr of the list generated by (all-tzids) generate reasonable outputs as examined below")
               (p (string-append "(car (all-tzids)) -> " (car (all-tzids)) "\n" "(cadr (all-tzids)) -> " (cadr (all-tzids)) "  Apparently you cannot use functions in here. However you can see the result of the functions evaluation at the beginning of the next line.")))))
 output)
 
(write-html-attribute-value-part-string (string-append "(car (all-tzids)) -> " (car (all-tzids)) "\n") output)
(write-html-attribute-value-part-string (string-append "(cadr (all-tzids)) -> " (cadr (all-tzids)) "\n") output)
(write-html-attribute-value-part (output-list (all-tzids)) output)

(close-output-port output)
```
The above code ended up producing this rather unappealing html document.

![output image](/output.png?raw=true "html image")

While I did not go very deep into the documentation I discovered that the `(write-html ((html (head...)` did not evaluate functions but cooperated with whitespace. However, the `(write-html-attribute-...)` did evaluate given functions but appeared to eat white spaces given to strings.
