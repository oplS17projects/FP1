## My Library: Imperative Queues
My name: Christopher Guyott

Write what you did!
Remember that this report must include:

I added some items to a queue with enqueue! and removed an item with dequeue!. Then I checked the length of the queue and converted the queue to a list. Finally I added four more elements to the list and then filtered out the even elements in the queue.

Overall, this is a really simple library, which provides a simple queue interface. There are many other similary Racket libraries that provide interfaces to data structures like this one. 

My code and output is shown in the image below.
