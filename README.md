# Final Project Assignment 1: Exploration (FP1)


http://docs.racket-lang.org/typed-stack/index.html

I used the racket's stack library. Before we had to write the stack from scratch in c in another class, 
so I though it would neat to use it when it has been already built. I was able to, create a stack, see if it is empty
pop, push, and top items. There was one function that say a procedure can be used on all of the values in the stack 
but I am not sure on how to use it. 

My highlight of the code is that I shortened the print function by defining it to a variable
```
(define (p x) (stack->list x))
```
![test image](/test.png?raw=true "test image")
