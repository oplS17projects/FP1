# Final Project Assignment 1: Exploration (FP1)


## My Library: net/sendurl
My name: Kshitij Karke


My initial thoughts are to do something related to stocks and alerts. I think I want to create a watchlist app that will automatically open up information/give information about a stock if there is a 10% growth in a single day.

I tested out some send-url commands and string commands. Maybe I can implemet displaying the data in racket itself by using some kind of a parser.
