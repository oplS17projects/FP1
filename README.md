# Final Project Assignment 1: Exploration (FP1)
## My Library: html-writing and tzinfo
My name: Robert Cucchiara

I explored the html-writing library and tzinfo libraries.  I used the tzinfo mostly to see how functions and other libraries would play with html-writing. I ended up creating a small html page that prints out each time zone in an unpleasant format. I was unable to properly format the output which is something I will look into should I continue to pursue html-writing. I tried several different ways to format the large chunk of time zones but `(write-html-attribute-value-part)` and its counter parts were not very receptive to white space.  The code for this can be seen below along with another snippet of code which I used to explore other methods provided by this library.

```racket
#lang racket

(require html-writing)
(require tzinfo)

;;I wrote this to hopefully get the list of tzids to print as they do in drracket.
(define (output-list lst)
  (if (null? lst)
      "\n"
      (string-append (car lst) "\n" (output-list (cdr lst)))))

(define output (open-output-file "test.html"))
(write-html
 '((html (head (title "My Test of HTML Writing and Time Zone"))
         (body (@ (bgcolor "white"))
               (h1 "Introduction")
               (p "My name is Rob and I am turning in this assignment very late.")
               (p "Sad face.")
               (h2 "Fun with tzinfo")
               (p "list of time zones:")
               (p "I am not sure why all of the time zones print out like this. When running the car and cadr of the list generated by (all-tzids) generate reasonable outputs as examined below")
               (p (string-append "(car (all-tzids)) -> " (car (all-tzids)) "\n" "(cadr (all-tzids)) -> " (cadr (all-tzids)) "  Apparently you cannot use functions in here. However you can see the result of the functions evaluation at the beginning of the next line.")))))
 output)
 
(write-html-attribute-value-part-string (string-append "(car (all-tzids)) -> " (car (all-tzids)) "\n") output)
(write-html-attribute-value-part-string (string-append "(cadr (all-tzids)) -> " (cadr (all-tzids)) "\n") output)
(write-html-attribute-value-part (output-list (all-tzids)) output)

(close-output-port output)
```
The above code ended up producing this rather unappealing html document.

![output image](/output.png?raw=true "html image")




Write what you did!
Remember that this report must include:

* a narrative of what you did
* highlights of code that you wrote, with explanation
* output from your code demonstrating what it produced
* at least one diagram or figure showing your work

The narrative itself should be no longer than 350 words. 

You need at least one image (output, diagrams). Images must be uploaded to your repository, and then displayed with markdown in this file; like this:

![test image](/testimage.png?raw=true "test image")

You must provide credit to the source for any borrowed images.

Code should be delivered in two ways:

1. Full files should be added to your version of this repository.
1. Key excerpts of your code should be copied into this .md file, formatted to look like code, and explained.

Ask questions publicly in the email group.

## How to Prepare and Submit this assignment

1. To start, [**fork** this repository][forking]. 
  2. (This assignment is just one README.md file, so you can edit it right in github)
1. Modify the README.md file and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your report.
1. Add your racket file to the repository. 
1. Ensure your changes (report in md file, and added rkt file) are committed to your forked repository.
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
