## My Library: Imperative Queues
My name: Christopher Guyott

Write what you did!
Remember that this report must include:

I added some items to a queue with enqueue! and removed an item with dequeue!. Then I checked the length of the queue and converted the queue to a list. Finally I added four more elements to the list and then filtered out the even elements in the queue.

* a narrative of what you did
* highlights of code that you wrote, with explanation
* output from your code demonstrating what it produced
* at least one diagram or figure showing your work

You must provide credit to the source for any borrowed images.

Code should be delivered in two ways:

1. Full files should be added to your version of this repository.
1. Key excerpts of your code should be copied into this .md file, formatted to look like code, and explained.

Ask questions publicly in the email group.
