Write what you did!
Remember that this report must include:

For this assignment, I was interested of the library plot for graph plotting by Neil Toronto.
The library provides a interface for producing all kinds of pots in 2D and 3D. The code was taken from one of his example. I modified one was the procedure which was the discrete-histogram and used it to show a graph of the exam 1 grade. The highlights of the code was made easy because of the library and procedure to create any form of graphs.
The output of the diagrams came out like I wanted.

You need at least one image (output, diagrams). Images must be uploaded to your repository, and then displayed with markdown in this file; like this:

![test image](/test.png?raw=true "Figure")

You must provide credit to the source for any borrowed images.

Code should be delivered in two ways:

1. Full files should be added to your version of this repository.
1. Key excerpts of your code should be copied into this .md file, formatted to look like code, and explained.

Ask questions publicly in the email group.
