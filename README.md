My library: 2htdp/image

My name: Hussain Dar

I decided to work with the 2htdp/image library because I thought it was a cool library that allows the user to construct images within images in several different ways. I thought I would try to make a basic connect four grid with pieces on it. I first had to make the pieces which have two different colors which are red and yellow. Making the pieces were not really hard as it required only one line of code for each one. Then I created the grid by first making a square with certain dimensions and used that square to help make the rectangle by connecting the squares together. After that I used the overlay/align function to play the pieces on the grid. However I had trouble properly getting the pieces on the board for I was able to make the pieces go in the middle properly but given that this is a exploration I thought I should focus more on learning the cool functions inside 2htdp/image. Some features I've learned in 2htdp/image was leaning how to rotate/scale/flip/crop and framming images.
