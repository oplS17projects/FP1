## My Library: Slideshow
My name: Mayur Khatri

I used the slideshow library to make a slideshow which showcases some of the features of the slideshow library, it is powerful because it has built in functions to switch slides, change colors and fonts, and add pictures. You can also start using the library with very little experience because of good, simple syntax.

Here is a piece of code which makes three slides, and shows how to add bullets with item and keys to switch slides.

And here is showing what the code produces
