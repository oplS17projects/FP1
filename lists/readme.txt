check-temps1:

	Refer to the test cases. I wrote 9 test cases for this function. The first were emtpy lists that both returned false. Then I checked the lower bond
        of 5 and got true. Then I checked all numbers within that range and got true. Next I checked the upper bound 95 and got ture. Then I tried 4 as one
        of the arugements and got false. Next I tried 97 as one of the arugments and got false. Then I tried zero as one of arugements and got false. Finaly
        I tried 100 as one of the arugements and got false.

check-temps:

        Refer to the test cases. The first two test cases are for checking to see if empty lists reutrn false which they do. The next test both boundires 
        with 5 as low and 15 as max, and it passed. The next two cases checked values within the given low and high and both passed. The next two I repeated
        A test case with one boundry and another for all within and both passed. I then made four tests for numbers outside the range and all four passed.
        next I made a three tests cases for low > high these all reutrned 'error as the low tempurature can't be greater than the high tempurature. All these 
        tests passed. Then I made 3 tests where low = high. I made one test where the inputs didn't match this number, reuturned false, and passed. An two other tests
        where all inputs = low =  high and reuturned true as they are not outside the range and passed.
