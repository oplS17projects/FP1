#lang racket

(require net/url)

(define myurl (string->url "http://ballotyelp.herokuapp.com/yelpsearch/sushi/lowell"))
;; String URL will basically creating a URL of type string, just like in Swift,
;; it would be URL(http://www blahblah.com)
(define myport (get-pure-port myurl))
;; myport then gets assigned the url to do its thing

;; 
(display-pure-port myport)

;; I honestly did not pick net/url because that was the example, but purely because I deployed my first API on Heroku today,
;; and I want to be able to use it. Currently, I'm learning a lot about servers in JavaScript, and I think that practicing
;; such skills on another functional programming language won't be such a bad idea. And besides, I LOVE parsing JSON because
;; I think they're beautiful, honestly. But I really hope it's not a huge pain on racket.

;; So my API allows any user to access the Yelp API without having to go through the OAuth authentication step, which proves to be
;; rather cumbersome to get access to. So the base URL for the request is "http://ballotyelp.herokuapp.com/yelpsearch/" and the next
;; two query arguments are used to search for certain items in the request.
